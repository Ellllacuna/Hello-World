# Overview

The game is a very simple platformer game. You play as a little puppy that collects mail to return to the friendly bear. The more mail you collect, the higher your score. It features animated sprites, npcs, and collection sounds.

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate how Python, and the Arcade library, can be used to create playable video games.
