# Overview

This software is a text adventure game made using c#. It's purpose is simply to demonstrate how one might use classes and inheritance in C# to make something like a game.

In the game itself, you are a member of the royal guard who is trying to rescue the prince after a violent coup. You defeat enemies and gather resources on your way to save the prince.
