1. * add temporary buffs to the stats screen, either as an additional stat or as
    a damage additiona
3. * figure out a way to quit once the game ends
4. * put in the duration of the buffs somewhere
5. add some encounter to the entry hall
4. same to garden
5. test with multiple enemies in one room. See how that works.
6. figure out something with the traitor's sword? right now it just shows as dropped, but there is no point in 
    equipping it, maybe have some sort of special marker and scene if you equip his sword?
7. Add a feature in where you have to choose to free the prince, right now it goes straight into the ending
    once the traitor dies.
8. * give variable drops to enemies, like a random chance rng thing
